Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.

I made this page in order to showcase my work on various projects and also as a way for visitors to contact me with inquiries or feedback about them.

I am currently active on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/vike_pic/) :camera:, you can DM me at any time or send me an [email](mailto:valcazar96@gmail.com) :love_letter:. I'm also open to questions / coffee / mentoring / whatever.

## About me :seedling:

I loved building things since i was a very little kid. My parents used to buy lots of [Playmobil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmobil) toys for me, and my brother and I practically built a world around them.

We imagined how they interacted between them and how would their homes and castles be laid out. He used to worry a lot about aesthetics (he's now a graphic designer) and i cared much about the functionality of it. In short, he worried about flames and cool looking banners and I about wether if they had enough beds to sleep in.

I think this had a great impact on me, and i used to daydream about demographic systems and civil architecture. When i discovered that i could build simulations of those thoughts on a machine, my fate was sealed - in a good way.
